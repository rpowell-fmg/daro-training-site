Which major has the highest percentage of women? (Hint: use `arrange(desc())` to easily see the top items)\n    - Output only relevant variables\n2. Get a list of STEM majors that have median earnings < \\$36,000\n    - (Hint: use the `%in%` to see if the `major_category` is in `stem_categories`)\n    - Output only relevant variables\n    - Use this code to create a list of STEM majors to compare to:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    stem_categories <- c(\"Biology & Life Science\",\n                         \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n                         \"Engineering\",\n                         \"Physical Sciences\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n    \n3. Output a count of the number of majors in each `major_category`\n\n**mutate, group_by, summarize**\n\n4. Create a new variable called `STEM` that is a 0/1 indicator if the major is in one of the `stem_categories` from #2 above.\n5. Which major category has the highest typical (can use `mean()`, `median()`, etc.) median income? (Hint: use `group_by()` and `summarize()`)\n6. Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, coloured by whether the major is in a STEM field or not.\n7. As time permits, review the data to create new variables, summarize different aspects, or visualize the data in different ways. Familiarize yourself with ggplot!",
